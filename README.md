# 🌍 EcoVision AI — Code That Saves Carbon

EcoVision AI is a sustainability intelligence dashboard that helps users **monitor, predict, and reduce** their daily resource consumption. By combining **real-time analytics, machine-learning powered forecasting, and actionable eco-recommendations**, the platform empowers individuals and organizations to make smarter, environment-friendly decisions every day.

This project was developed during a hackathon with a strong focus on **practical real-world impact** — enabling users to visualize their energy, water, and carbon usage through an intuitive interface, while also guiding them toward meaningful reductions in waste.
